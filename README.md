# Twitter Updater System.
 This application is meant to fetch news update form newsapi.org and post the update with link to twitter.

 I intend to run this as a cron on linux. it executes every 3 hours. picks news from different categories and makes sure no news is repeated.<br />

 The history of the news posted will be kept in a google sheet.
